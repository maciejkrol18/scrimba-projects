# ðŸŽ“ Scrimba projects

This is a repository for all of the projects i've done for Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path course up until "React Basics" chapter - from now i will upload them as separate repositories as they grow in complexity. Most of the projects are solo project (requirements only, without instructions). Every project folder has a README with the project's completion date and eventual notes. Below you can find a table with links to live previews of each project. The entries are sorted from newest to oldest.

|  **Project title** |                               **Live site link**                              |
